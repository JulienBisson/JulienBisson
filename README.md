Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julien and I graduated from the Wagon bootcamp where I was able to acquire a solid foundation in back-end and front-end development.
The wagon bootcamp is an intensive training over 9 weeks where you see the fundamentals of the code in order to be able to create applications. It is a professional retraining after having worked for years in the conduct of works in the construction industry.

A new passion has dawned on me and I'm very happy with the direction my professional career in tech is taking.

I can't wait to be able to learn even more and improve my skills on all kinds of subjects.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two projects which are :
  > HelpRH: an application to help employees find out about their rights and duties in accordance with their collective agreement.
  > ...: an application for organizing events around board games so that people can meet and play together


ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning to improve my skills on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript

ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn, Slack or mail.
